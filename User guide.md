## Introduction<a name="Introduction"></a>

The VirtualLoop is a SDLC-to-Ethernet Bus Interface Unit device.  Tested with a variety of brands of 2070 and ATC controllers, the VirtualLoop is flexible to work in many cabinet environments and a variety of different detection sensors.
	
### Intended use
	
The VirtualLoop serves as a translator for various detection technologies to be able to represent themselves to the traffic controller in a manner similar to inductive loops.  The sensor (camera, lidar, etc) places a call to the VirtualLoop REST API which is translated into calls through TS2 SDLC.

### SDLC

TS2 Port 1 Serves as BIU 1-4, each with 16 detectors.  The BIU assignments and Detector calls can be operated through the Web Server "Detector" page and REST API.

### Relays (DIN Rail Model)

8 relays (C/NO/NC contacts) each can switch a max of 1A @ 125VAC or 60VDC

Relays are numbered 1 through 8 with 1 closest to the front of the unit.  Each relay includes Common, Normally Open, and Normally Closed contacts.

## Factory reset<a name="FactoryReset"></a>

Holding the front button for 5 seconds (or longer) and releasing will factory reset the device.
	
## Web Server<a name="WebServer"></a>

**About page** - Reports version, internal voltage, device name, etc.

**Network configuration page** - Used to set the device IP through either DHCP or Static addressing

<kbd><img width="396" alt="2025-01-23 12_49_35-Apex Talos VirtualLoop" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7da69c1c-1a48-4f9f-b282-35be76ae86cd" /></kbd>

**Detector selection page** - Allows the user to force a detector on or off through the UI.  Also reports the number of detector activation counts and provides the user a droplist of the load switch numbers for mapping in ATSPM data

<kbd><img width="396" alt="2025-01-23 12_49_56-Apex Talos VirtualLoop" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae04f788-682d-466b-9021-22971ee01b02" /></kbd>

**Failsafe monitoring page** - The device can monitor upto 4 IP address and ports.  Typically these would be the camera detection devices.  If the connection is not accepted within the specified number of seconds and failure counts, the VirtualLoop will go into FAILSAFE mode and automatically hold calls on all detectors.

<kbd><img width="396" alt="2025-01-23 12_50_30-Apex Talos VirtualLoop" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/163a9e9e-c5fa-4300-9b34-c5ed7b8b7cfa" /></kbd>

**System page** - System functions like name, reboot, and factory reset.
